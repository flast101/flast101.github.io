## Career

I am a cybersecurity engineer living in France, found of security and pentest. I am graduated from the ESIEE school in Paris in telecomuncations and networks, and passed a "Master 2" in cybersecurity in AMU (Aix-Marseille University). I am now employed as presales engineer in charge of security solutions in a software company, 

## OSCP Preparation

I am currently preparing the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) (Offensive Security Certified Professional) certificate. This course is great. The student is provided with a 850 pages book and video walk-through, and an access to a virtual penetration testing lab consisting of a total of 70 mahcines (50 can be accessed on the "public" network), in which students learn to conduct a penetration test from start to finish and practice techniques.    
To earn the coveted OSCP certification, students must complete PWK and pass a proCtored exam. The exam has a 24-hour time limit and consists of a hands-on penetration test in an isolated VPN network.

I enrolled the PWK-OSCP course early february 2020 and subscribed for 3 months training period. I didn't attempt the exam yet ad will probably resub for a lab access before I attempt the exam (probably end 2020).

When working in the PWK lab, there is no writeup or walkthrough available and neither students nor OSCP certified are allowed to provide information about the lab solutions.    

Here are the 27 machines I rooted so far (May 2020) in the PWK Lab :    
_**Alice, Phoenix, Mike, Disco, Bob, Ralph, Pain, LeftTurn, Bethany, Alpha, BETA, Gamme, Bruce, Break, 1nsider, Tophat, Dotty, fc4, Susie, Kraken, Hotline, Joe, Core, Parrot.**_

## Online Cybersecurity Platforms Activity

I am also an active member of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu), two well known online platforms for learning and practicing cyber security and pentesting.
